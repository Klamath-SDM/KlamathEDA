Klamath Basin Project Awards,USFW,NA,Oregon Gulch Project on Mainstem Trinity River ,2022,New,NA,NA,NA,NA,CA,"Funding will be used, in part, to fund removal of over 330,000 cubic yards of mining tailings to address intense disturbances to the Trinity River and valley caused by historical gold mining. During the period of upslope hydraulic mining in the late 19th century, mining debris washed off the hillslope buried the historical valley bottom, and subsequent dredging in the first half of the 20th century coupled with fluvial incision left a narrow canal-like channel with almost no functional floodplain area. This resulted in a section of river with extremely poor rearing, spawning, and adult holding habitat with pronounced limitations to rearing habitat capacity between frequent river flows of 450 cfs and 8000 cfs. The project site is located just below the Sheridan Riffle which has the highest density of natural spawning in the restoration reach of the main stem Trinity River. ",NA,https://www.fws.gov/program/klamath-basin-project-awards

Klamath Basin Project Awards,USFW,NA,Quartz Valley Integrated Hydrological Model ,2022,New,NA,NA,NA,NA,CA,"Funding for this project will be used to improve the understanding of the integrated surface water and groundwater system in the Quartz Valley so that the Quartz Valley Indian Reservation and other water managers can effectively manage their limited water supplies. The Quartz Valley uses both surface water and groundwater to meet their water needs. Because the surface water system is fully allocated, the Quartz Valley has been relying more on groundwater to meet its increasing demands for water. Past studies have recognized the interconnection between groundwater and surface water in the Scott Valley (Hathaway, 2012), and the groundwater and surface water systems are likely connected in the Quartz Valley as well; however, this interconnection was not recognized in the adjudication and presently there are no limitations on groundwater usage. The increased use of groundwater is a major concern in the Quartz Valley. Four of the QVIR tribal wells have gone dry in recent years, which has caused concerns about available drinking water. There have also been water quality issues, including E. coli contamination. This funding will be used to develop the Quartz Valley Integrated Hydrologic Model (QVIHM). This model will build upon a groundwater model of the entire Scott River Valley Groundwater Basin called the Scott Valley Integrated Hydrologic Model, which was developed and is being maintained by a team at UC Davis to support the Scott Valley Groundwater Sustainability Plan. The QVIHM can be used to help identify strategies to help restore flows in the surface water system and restore salmon habitat in Shackleford Creek. Analysis of groundwater flow paths and other model outputs will help water managers identify management strategies to improve water quality issues. ",NA,https://www.fws.gov/program/klamath-basin-project-awards

These strategies will include placement of in-channel structures that will capture sediment and reengage the floodplain and its historic channels. These changes or additions to the channel complexity will increase hydraulic residence time over a broader area and raise the local water table resulting in and enhancement to the late summer/early fall stream flows with higher quality channel habitat and opportunities for fish passage through the degraded reach. In addition to raising the water table and increasing stream flows, the increased channel complexity will support existing riparian vegetation as well as sediment capture and recruitment of emergent vegetation and associated habitat.  ",NA,https://www.fws.gov/program/klamath-basin-project-awards
Klamath Basin Project Awards,USFW,NA,Sugar Creek Coho Salmon Refugia Project ,2022,New,NA,NA,NA,NA,CA,"Funding for this project will be used to connect one acre of slow, cold-water refugia rearing habitat to one acre of floodplain habitat constructed in an earlier phase of this project. When complete, this project will result in a total two acres of new high quality rearing habitat for juvenile coho salmon, and connects Sugar Creek, a key Scott River watershed spawning and rearing stream, to the new habitat. The purpose of this project is to increase the production of Scott Watershed coho salmon, a native fish population that has been deemed hatchery influence free by NOAA, thereby supporting down listing of the species. The new permanent cold water rearing areas have been designed to withstand climate change and drought, and also provide rich food resources that allow juvenile fish to thrive and grow large, even as ambient and stream temperatures rise, thereby increasing survival into adulthood. The project builds on 10 years of restoration actions, and associated effectiveness monitoring, within Sugar Creek that demonstrated a thousand-fold increase in juvenile coho production over pre-restoration conditions.  ",NA,https://www.fws.gov/program/klamath-basin-project-awards
Klamath Basin Project Awards,USFW,NA,Development of models for predicting annelid hosts in the Klamath River Hydroelectric Reach ,2022,New,NA,NA,NA,NA,OR,"This funding will be used to test and refine predictive models for annelid hosts in the Klamath River hydroelectric reach, which will inform and improve management decisions in the Klamath Basin. High annelid host densities, which are linked to fish disease in the Klamath River, have been described in the J.C. Boyle Bypass and Keno reaches of the Klamath River hydroelectric reach. Understanding the factors driving annelid host distribution and density in the hydroelectric reach is critical to the success of salmon recovery and future habitat restoration efforts. A predictive model was previously developed for annelids located in the current infectious zone, downstream from Iron Gate Dam. The model has been used to predict the distribution and density of infected annelids and evaluate effects of managed flow events downstream from Iron Gate Dam. This approach can be applied in the hydroelectric reach, however model performance should first be evaluated because the model may require refinement due to the unique hydraulic and sediment conditions that characterize the Klamath River hydroelectric reaches. The proposed work will build on the previous model to 1) test and refine our understanding of relationships between flow variability and the distribution and relative abundance of M. occidentalis in various habitat types, 2) contribute to a long-term data set quantifying the conditions leading to the presence of annelids and C. shasta infection, and 3) provide a tool for evaluating the potential successes proposed of flow-control or habitat restoration actions (e.g., gravel augmentation) targeted toward salmon habitat in the Klamath River hydroelectric reach. or habitat restoration actions. ",NA,https://www.fws.gov/program/klamath-basin-project-awards

Following dam removal on the Klamath River, salmon and steelhead are expected to return to the Upper Klamath Basin. The “Keno Reach” has severe water quality problems. The plan will also identify opportunities for the construction of diffuse source treatment wetlands to locally treat agricultural runoff from adjacent agricultural drains. An analysis of existing topographic and bathymetric data in the project reach will be performed to identify areas where fringe wetland creation, restoration, and/or enhancement are possible. The project team will then initiate an outreach effort to landowners along the project reach to gauge interest in future participation in wetland restoration/enhancement projects. Data from these first tasks will be captured and stored in a database that serve as the basis for future wetland project development. This will include high-resolution topo-bathymetric data collection following a controlled burn in the spring of 2023, evaluation and modeling of site hydrology, and identification of alternatives for improving water circulation through the existing wetlands.

A population of Lost River suckers spawn exclusively at eastern shoreline springs in Upper Klamath Lake (UKL). Most of these springs have been degraded by alterations to the surrounding area including development of the railway and highway adjacent to the shoreline of the lake. Current Lost River sucker spawning is restricted to four small shoreline spring areas including: Sucker, Ouxy, Cinder Flat, and Silver Building. Due to on-going drought conditions only Sucker Springs has substantial spring discharge and large numbers of spawning fish.  Since all of the spawning areas are located in shallow shoreline areas, they are greatly affected by lake levels. The Klamath Tribes will implement additional spawning habitat enhancement activities at other springs along the shoreline of Upper Klamath Lake.
